"""WebSocket fan-out hub.

A tiny pub-sub used by background workers (downloader,
exporter, reachability probe) to push events to every
connected UI client without each worker knowing how many
there are.

Thread-safety: all ``broadcast`` calls happen from the event
loop (background tasks created via ``asyncio.create_task``).
The downloader progress sink is called from a blocking worker
thread; it schedules ``broadcast`` onto the loop via
``asyncio.run_coroutine_threadsafe`` — see
:class:`WebSink` in ``sync_worker.py``.
