"""Local archive retention.

Two independent rules, both optional and zero-disabled:

* time cap (``max_days``) — delete clips older than N days
* disk-pressure cap (``disk_pct``) — when used disk % is at/above

A separate flag (``protect_ro``) shields read-only / locked clips
from both rules. The actual ``sweep()`` function tying these to
the database lives below; the eligibility decision is factored out
as a pure function so it can be unit-tested without touching disk.
