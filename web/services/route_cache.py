"""Per-day cache of the aggregated GPS route payload.

Building a day's route re-parses every GPX sidecar for that day, which is
slow on a large archive (tens of seconds for hundreds of clips) and runs
on every day-view / route request. The result only changes when the day's
GPX files change, so cache it keyed by a signature of those files
(path + mtime + size) and rebuild only on a mismatch.

Persisted as a JSON sidecar under ``$RECORDINGS/.route_cache/<date>.json``
so it survives restarts — mirroring the ``.thumbs`` / ``.filmstrips``
caches. Labels are NOT cached here: they come from the geocode cache and
are applied fresh by the caller, so they stay current as that cache fills.
