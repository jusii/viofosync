"""FastAPI application factory for the viofosync web UI.

Usage::

    uvicorn web.app:create_app --factory --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080

Reads :mod:`web.settings` on startup, wires up auth, opens the
SQLite state store, mounts the static SPA, and includes all
routers. Background workers (SyncWorker, ExportWorker) are
started in the ``startup`` event and stopped cleanly on shutdown.
