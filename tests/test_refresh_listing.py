"""Tests for SyncWorker._refresh_listing_and_reconcile.

Pinning the regression: during a long sync drain the queue used
to only refresh once per cycle, so clips the dashcam recorded
mid-drain didn't appear in the UI's queue until the cycle
ended. The helper is now called between every successful
download to keep the queue current.
